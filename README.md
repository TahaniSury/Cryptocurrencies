# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies, A clustering algorithm is used to group data and hvPlot visualization are used to share results.

## Results:

### Elbow Curve

. From the elbow curve above, it can be determined that the optimal number of clusters is 4 (k=4).

### Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
